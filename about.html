				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Each team is provided a 10 HP Briggs and Stratton engine and a competition rulebook to which they must comply. Other than these constraints, the team is left free to design every other component of the vehicle.</p>

					<h3>Unparalleled learning experience</h3>
					<p>Our purpose is to provide all of our members with hands-on experience and real world engineering knowledge that cannot be obtained in the classroom alone.</p>
					<p>The main advantage of the Baja team is that it enhances a student's classroom learning experience, ultimately augmenting their University Degree. Furthermore, students gain exposure to critical project management aspects of engineering, including teamwork, cost control, scheduling, and work breakdown.</p>
					<p>In addition, Baja also necessitates attributes not taught in the classroom, such as seeking sponsors and responsibility. Students have to design a vehicle subsystem, create a budget for it, manufacture it and ultimately be responsible guarantee its functionality.</p>

								<div class="slide-description">
									<p>Fall term marked the start of a new year for the UW Baja SAE Team. Our team is comprised of 26 UW engineering students.</p>
									<p>Seven 4th year senior members are responsible for the design and optimization of the Baja Car while 19 junior members, assist, get their hands dirty and learn as much as possible about engineering design and real world applications.</p>
									<p>Interested in joining the team? Head over to the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to sign up for our mailing list and recieve updates on team meetings and bulletins.</p>

								<div class="slide-description">
									<p>Tougher. The University of Waterloo Baja vehicle is built to handle the most hostile terrain. Crawling up steep hills and blasting through mud.  Off-road racing stresses this car out less than a grade school test stresses an Engineer.</p>
									<p>Faster. Challenge accepted.</p>
									<p>New designs, lighter weight, more dynamic. No problem.</p>

									<p>The Baja team has a yearly operating cost of roughly $25 000. The Baja team relies on the generosity of its sponsors to remain liquid. On a typical year the Baja team hunts for and attains 20 different sponsors, all with varying degrees of donations.</p>
